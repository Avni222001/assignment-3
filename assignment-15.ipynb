    "A database is an organized collection of data used for easy storage, retrieval, and management of information. There are two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SQL Databases:** These are structured, relational databases using tables with predefined layouts. Data is organized in rows (records) and columns (fields). Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. Key features:\n",
    "   - **Structured data:** Organized in predefined tables with fixed schemas.\n",
    "   - **ACID properties:** Transactions ensure data integrity.\n",
    "   - **Strong consistency:** Data adheres to strict rules, preventing inconsistencies.\n",
    "   - **Complex queries:** Good at handling intricate queries across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NoSQL Databases:** These handle diverse data types and high scalability. They're flexible, but might sacrifice strict consistency. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis. Key features:\n",
    "   - **Schema flexibility:** Can store dynamic, schema-less data.\n",
    "   - **Distributed and scalable:** Scale horizontally for large volumes and high traffic.\n",
    "   - **Eventual consistency:** Prioritize availability and speed over strict consistency.\n",
    "   - **Various data models:** Support different structures (key-value, document, column-family, graph).\n",

    "DDL stands for \"Data Definition Language.\" It's a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that focuses on defining and managing the structure of a database, including tables, schemas, constraints, and other database objects. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete these structural elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are explanations and examples of some common DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, or views. It defines the structure of the object and its attributes.\n",
    "EXAMPLE: CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",

    "Sure, let's delve into Primary Keys and Foreign Keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Key:**\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record (row) in that table. It serves as a means to ensure the uniqueness and integrity of the data in the table. Every table should have a primary key, and no two records in the table should have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "- Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across all records in the table.\n",
    "- Non-null: A primary key value cannot be NULL, as it needs to uniquely identify a record.\n",
    "- Fixed: The primary key value should remain constant over the lifetime of the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a \"Students\" table where each student has a unique \"StudentID\" as their primary key:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
    "    StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    FirstName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    LastName VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Age INT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign Key:**\n",
    "A foreign key is a column in a database table that establishes a link between data in two different tables. It creates a relationship between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. The foreign key column in one table refers to the primary key column in another table, creating a connection between the records in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "- References: A foreign key column refers to the primary key column of another table, creating a relationship between them.\n",
    "- Data Integrity: Foreign keys ensure that data in related tables is consistent. Values in the foreign key column must correspond to values in the referenced primary key column.\n",
    "- Referential Integrity: Foreign key constraints can be defined to enforce rules that maintain the integrity of the relationship between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a \"Courses\" table with a foreign key \"StudentID\" that references the primary key \"StudentID\" in the \"Students\" table:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Courses (\n",
    "    CourseID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    CourseName VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "    StudentID INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (StudentID) REFERENCES Students(StudentID)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the \"StudentID\" column in the \"Courses\" table is a foreign key that establishes a connection with the \"Students\" table, ensuring that the referenced student ID exists in the \"Students\" table. This maintains the integrity of the relationship between students and their enrolled courses.\n",
